#Example 4. In order to print a integer alongside strings, you have to convert the value to a string.
#as you cannot print different datatypes together.

#Shrek code, this will generate a error. Remove comment for example.
#Print("OH NO SHREK CODE!")
#print("your age is: "+age1)

#Fixed shrek code, converted integer into a string. This is called a "StringCast"
print("Example 4, corrected code now wworks! Integer and string in harmony!")
print("Your age is: "+str(age2))
