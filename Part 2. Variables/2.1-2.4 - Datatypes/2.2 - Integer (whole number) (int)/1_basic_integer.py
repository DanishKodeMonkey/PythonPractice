
#There are 4 datatypes of Variables
#The second type is the integer datatype, for int for short.

#When forming a integer make sure not to envelop with "" as that is only used for string datatypes
#and can normally not be used for any sort of math.

#Example one, add 1 to whatever value age is already defined as and print. Results in 30 here
print("Example 1, the long way.")
age1 = 29
age1 = age1 + 1
print(age1)

#Shorthand way of writing this would be, a kind of shortcut.
print("Example 2, the shorthand way(shortcut)")
age2 = 30
age2 += 1
print(age2)

#You can examine the datatype of a variable with the type function
print("Example 3, examining the datatype of the variable age2, int is short for integer")
print(type(age2))

#Integers only store whole interger numbers, no decimals!.
