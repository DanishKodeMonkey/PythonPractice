#Example 4. Combine several of the same variable datatype. Eg. String+String
#Starting over, making two variables named first_name and last_name
#common naming convention is two seperate two words in a variable name with a _

#First variable
first_name = "Daniel"
#Second variable
last_name = "Runge"
#Third variable combines first two variables, with a string space to seperate them in print.
full_name = first_name +" "+ last_name

#Finally, print for profit!"
print("Hello "+full_name)
