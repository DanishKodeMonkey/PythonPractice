# A container for a value, it behaves as the value it contains.

print(name)
#Example 2. Variables can used in combination with strings
print("example 2 - added basic hello before name variable")

#Example 3. Examine datatype of a variable by preceding with "type" function.
print("example 3 Examined datatype with type function, str is short for string")
print(type(name))
