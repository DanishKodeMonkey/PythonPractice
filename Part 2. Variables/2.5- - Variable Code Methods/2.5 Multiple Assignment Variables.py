#Multiple assignment allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.

#Example 1
#Old one line definitions
#name = "Daniel"
#age = 29
#smart = True

#Multiple assignment definitions
print("Example 1, using multiple assignment in-code")
name, age, smart = "Daniel", 29, True

print(name)
print(age)
print(smart)

#Result is the same in print, but is useful for sorting and keeping data together.

#Example 2 - Assign the same value to multiple variables with multiple assignment
#Old single line definitions
#Kris = 30
#Kai = 30
#Dan = 30
#Zan = 30

#Multiple variable definition
print("Example 2, using Multiple variable to assign several variables to the same value")
Kris = Kai = Dan = Zan = 30

print(Kris)
print(Kai)
print(Dan)
print(Zan)
